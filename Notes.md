## 4GB Patcher
[4GB patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62552?tab=description) should be installed manually into the fallout new vegas folder.

## New Vegas Bounties
Make sure to not have New Vegas Bounties III enabled
until you have completed NVB I and II. Now NVB I and II
can and should both be enabled at the same time.

## Western Skies
Please make sure you only have one plugin selected 
for Western Skies. When installed in MO2 it does 
not give you options so you will have to do this manually.

## 3000 and 6000
Only one mod needs to be selected for 3000 and
6000. 6000 is for a higher end pc and 3000 is
for a lower end one.

## Fallout Character Overhaul and Patches
Only select the options on these patches for the mods
that are downlaoded. ***For FCO that is Afterschool Special, Beyond Boulder Dome
Saxon's Quest Collection, Willow, Niner and Russell.***
For YUP Patches tht is ***Afterschool Special and Willow*** If you have 
Red Question marks that means you have installed FCO wrong and should reinstall it.
