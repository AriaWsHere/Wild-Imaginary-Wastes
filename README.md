# Wild-Imaginary-Wastes



  
  
  
Hello I'm Aria and if you are here on this page that means either you got lost on the internet 
or you have just installed my first modlist Wild Imaginary Wastes: A Neo Cowboy Experience. 
The purpose of this modlist is to create a neo-western experience for a game that already has 
very heavy western undertones. Neo-western is a strange mix of futuristic technology and old 
world technology that makes for a very interesting genre. In this modlist you will find weapon 
mods from WWII back to Frontier America and everything in between. In future iterations I will 
be attempting to remove all weapons that are not from this time period but for now I cannot 
figure out how to so I replaced as many as I could. You will also find new quests and ways to 
play the game thanks to the amazing mod community on nexus. Please if you can go endorse all of 
these wonderful authors. This modlist will be updated periodicaly as I find new mods and manage 
to create replacer patches. I took inspiration for this modlist from a youtuber know as 
[Boylei Hobby Time](https://youtu.be/hrOcG9Vh7cM?si=8HA_wPRERH3zd957) and his "wild Imaginary West" playlist of dioramas as well as a free (at the time of typing) 
game called Falsepine. Without further ado I will post instructions for the modlist.

# Notes

## 4GB Patcher
[4GB patcher](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62552?tab=description) should be installed manually into the fallout new vegas folder.

## New Vegas Bounties
Make sure to not have New Vegas Bounties III enabled
until you have completed NVB I and II. Now NVB I and II
can and should both be enabled at the same time.

## Western Skies
Please make sure you only have one plugin selected 
for Western Skies. When installed in MO2 it does 
not give you options so you will have to do this manually.

## 3000 and 6000
Only one mod needs to be selected for 3000 and
6000. 6000 is for a higher end pc and 3000 is
for a lower end one.

## Fallout Character Overhaul and Patches
Only select the options on these patches for the mods
that are downlaoded. ***For FCO that is Afterschool Special, Beyond Boulder Dome
Saxon's Quest Collection, Willow, Niner and Russell.***
For YUP Patches tht is ***Afterschool Special and Willow*** If you have 
Red Question marks that means you have installed FCO wrong and should reinstall it.
