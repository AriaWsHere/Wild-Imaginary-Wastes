# Wild-Imaginary-Wastes



  
  
  
Hello I'm Aria and if you are here on this page that means either you got lost on the internet 
or you have just installed my first modlist Wild Imaginary Wastes: A Neo Cowboy Experience. 
The purpose of this modlist is to create a neo-western experience for a game that already has 
very heavy western undertones. Neo-western is a strange mix of futuristic technology and old 
world technology that makes for a very interesting genre. In this modlist you will find weapon 
mods from WWII back to Frontier America and everything in between. In future iterations I will 
be attempting to remove all weapons that are not from this time period but for now I cannot 
figure out how to so I replaced as many as I could. You will also find new quests and ways to 
play the game thanks to the amazing mod community on nexus. Please if you can go endorse all of 
these wonderful authors. This modlist will be updated periodicaly as I find new mods and manage 
to create replacer patches. I took inspiration for this modlist from a youtuber know as 
[Boylei Hobby Time](https://youtu.be/hrOcG9Vh7cM?si=8HA_wPRERH3zd957) and his "wild Imaginary West" playlist of dioramas as well as a free (at the time of typing) 
game called Falsepine. Without further ado I will post instructions for the modlist.


Notes: You will need a fresh install of [fallout new vegas](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/22380/) on steam , [mod organizer 2](https://www.modorganizer.org) and [Loot](https://loot.github.io). I do not suppoort pirated versions of the game.
